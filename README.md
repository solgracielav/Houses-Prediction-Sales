# **Sales Prediction Using Real Estate Data**

This project involves predicting house sale prices using data from over 9,200 real estate transactions. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors influencing property values, including basement size, year built, and number of bedrooms.

---

## **Overview**
- **Goal**: Develop predictive insights into factors affecting house sale prices.
- **Methods**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and correlation analysis.
- **Output**: Regression models and visualizations highlighting relationships between property features and sale price.

## **Files and Structure**
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `pierce_co_house_sales.csv`: Dataset containing house sale data.
- `MiniProject2_SOLVLOEBERGH.Rmd`: R Markdown script used for analysis.
- `MiniProject2_SOLVLOEBERGH.html`: HTML output summarizing the project.
- `MINIPROJECT2_SV.html`: Another version of the project output.
- `MINIPROJECT2_SV.Rmd`: Supporting R Markdown file for analysis.

## **Technologies Used**
- **R Programming**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: To create visualizations like scatterplots and boxplots.
- **Regression Modeling**: To examine relationships between predictors and sale price.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: To assess the significance of various predictors.

---

## **Key Insights**
- Homes with basements larger than 2,000 sq. ft. had an estimated average price increase of $450,000 compared to homes without basements.
- Year built showed a weak positive correlation with sale price (r = 0.325), indicating newer homes generally have higher values.
- Homes with more bedrooms had higher average sale prices, but variability within categories reduced the overall correlation (r = 0.20).

## **How to Reproduce**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sales-Prediction-Project.git
   ```
2. Load the dataset (`pierce_co_house_sales.csv`) into R.
3. Run the analysis scripts (`MiniProject2_SOLVLOEBERGH.Rmd` or `MINIPROJECT2_SV.Rmd`) to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
